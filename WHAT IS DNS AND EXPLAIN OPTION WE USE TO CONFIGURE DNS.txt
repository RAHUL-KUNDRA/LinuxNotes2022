****DNS server**** 

It stands for Domain name system. It is used for translating/resolving name into ip address
& vice versa.This service works on port no. 53

Developed in the 80’s by students at Berkeley University, BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) is an open source DNS server that provides DNS services on Linux distributions.

**There are two types of zones**

1. Forward lookup zone = resolve name to ip address

2. Reverse lookup zone = resolve ip address to name

**There are two types of sub zones**

1. Primary zone

2. secondary zone

**DNS records**

1.SOA (set/start of authority) = It's a first record of any zone file

2.NS (Name server)             = It represents DNS server name

3.A  (host)		       = It represents resolve name into ip

4.PTR (pointer record)	       = It represent resolve ip address into name

5.MX (mail exchange)	       = It represents mailing server

6.Cname (canonical name)       = It represents second name of name server


**DNS parameters**

TTL:	 	This is short for Time-To-Live. TTL is the duration of time (or hops) that a packet exists in a network before finally being discarded by the router.

IN:	 	This implies the Internet.

SOA:	 	This is short for the Start of Authority. Basically, it defines the authoritative name server, 
		in this case, dns-primary.linuxtechi.local and contact information – admin.linuxtechi.local

NS:		This is short for Name Server.

A: 		This is an A record. It points to a domain/subdomain name to the IP Address

Serial: 	This is the attribute used by the DNS server to ensure that contents of a specific zone file are updated.

Refresh:	Defines the number of times that a slave DNS server should transfer a zone from the master.

Retry: 		Defines the number of times that a slave should retry a non-responsive zone transfer.

Expire: 	Specifies the duration a slave server should wait before responding to a client query when the Master is unavailable.

Minimum: 	This is responsible for setting the minimum TTL for a zone.

MX: 		This is the Mail exchanger record. It specifies the mail server receiving and sending emails

CNAME: 		This is the Canonical Name. It maps an alias domain name to another domain name.

PTR: 		Short for Pointer, this attributes resolves an IP address to a domain name, opposite to a domain name.
